## Notes for LLMs

When modifying this subsystem:

1. **Update Tests**: Add tests for new features
2. **Update This README**: Keep documentation current with changes
3. **Update Commit Hash Before Committing**: When asked to commit, update the "Previous Commit" hash at the top of this file to reference the commit that existed BEFORE the changes being committed

### Commit Workflow

When the user says "commit":
1. Check `git log --oneline -1` for current commit hash
2. Update "Previous Commit" in this README to that hash
3. Update "Last Updated" date if significant changes
4. Stage changes and commit with descriptive message
