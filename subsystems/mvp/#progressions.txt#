Note: any time I say skinning knife here, I just mean a knife. Any knife can be used for skinning

* use stick as makeshift shovel to get clay
  * clay comes from digging dirt that is next to water
    * Orrr just have clay substrate instead
  - will need to equip the stick
  
* use a rock as a makeshift knapping tool to knap flint into crude blade
  - need to equip the rock
  - for convenience, when crafting, auto-equip the right tool
    - auto-equip means the frontend executes the equip command for you before
      tring the craft command

* the flint knife blade can be used as a makeshift skinning knife
  - also allows extracting bones, sinew, and meat from carcasses

* food system for now will just be for healing
  * stretch goal: you get the stat buff of the most recently eaten food
    - so when you eat next food, last buff gets overriden

* access to bone means you can make a crude pickaxe

* crafting the skinning knife from wood/bone handle,
  - knife handle requires at least medium size material (so small bones wont do)
  - larger tools like pickage would require large bone to make handle
  - but stick counts as large size so can be used for medium and large handles

* durability of the crafted skinning knife will be <max skinning knife durability> minus durability already subtracted from the blade
  - since presumably we will have already used the blade as a makeshift knife


* bone pickaxe allows us to mine copper, but tin will only be in the mountains
  and the mountains biome will require further progression
  - handle, bone pickaxe head, binding

* the player will then have a choice whether to progress to iron by making
  copper tools to mine the iron, or to progress to bronze by accessing the
  mountains
  - iron will require more infrastructure while bronze will require more exploration/adventure

* chopping wood should be fairly early
  * crude axe from flint axe head, handle, and binding

* binding early can be from plant fibers, sinews
  - later binding can come from tanning leather then cutting into strip

* durability of tool: (base handle durability + base head durability) * binding durability multiplier


* other items:
  - chest
  - bed
  -
