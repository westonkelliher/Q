NEXT: add CLI REPL
THEN: refactor the README


* first step crafting: copy the important data structures from
  crafting_tinkers
* early progression content
* crafting mechanic
* content
@ multi display floor items (2x2 then 3x3 max 4x4)
* quest system to guide early progression


* Have tile position within land stay consistent as long as the player does not
  leave that land in the terrain view. When the player does leave the land and
  enter a new land, their tile position in that land should be based on the
  direction that they came from. The player will be in the middle of the edge
  of the side that they came from. Use the "drive on the right side rule" e.g.
  if coming from the top the player will be just left of center in the top row
  (index 3) since they are traveling downward


* minimap of terrain view when in land view
  * stretch: animate terrain view becoming minimap
  * stretch: animate singular lad tile becoming full spread land
* combine ra-horns with another icon for an enemy
  - All background/outlines drawn first, and then all foregrounds drawn on top.
* Use different animal symbols, including the bunny, the wolf, and the lion as
  various enemies.
* Use sick icons for gear on top of the player.
