# Complex Crafting Sequence - Building a Scimitar
# This demonstrates the full three-tier crafting system:
# 1. Simple items (raw materials)
# 2. Components (crafted from submaterials)
# 3. Composite (assembled from components)

# Step 1: Create raw materials
# We need: iron ore (x2), oak wood, deer leather
n iron_ore
n iron_ore
n oak_wood
n deer_leather

# Step 2: Check inventory
i

# Step 3: Smelt iron bars (Simple recipe: 2 iron_ore -> 1 iron_bar)
# Use inventory indices 0 and 1 (the two iron_ore)
c smelt_iron_bar 0 1

# Step 4: Check inventory - should have iron_bar, oak_wood, deer_leather
i

# Step 5: Craft components from submaterials
# Craft scimitar blade from iron_bar (Component recipe)
# Use inventory index 0 (the iron_bar)
c craft_scimitar_blade 0

# Step 6: Craft handle from oak_wood (Component recipe)
# Use inventory index 1 (the oak_wood)
c craft_handle 1

# Step 7: Craft binding from deer_leather (Component recipe)
# Use inventory index 2 (the deer_leather)
c craft_binding 2

# Step 8: Check inventory - should have 3 components
i

# Step 9: Assemble scimitar from components (Composite recipe)
# Scimitar slots: blade, handle, binding (in that order)
# Use inventory indices 0, 1, 2 (blade, handle, binding)
c assemble_scimitar 0 1 2

# Step 10: Final inventory check - should have the scimitar!
i

# Step 11: Show the scimitar details
sin 0

# Step 12: List recipes to see what else we can craft
